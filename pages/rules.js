wireframes.rules = `<h1>Photop Rules</h1><p>Photop exists as a safe place for users to share their thoughts, feelings, and interests. Unfortunately, nothing on this earth can be perfect by default, so we have to enforce a set of rules so users know exactly what to expect when they start posting and chatting. By using Photop, you agree to these terms of service, and you agree that action will be taken on your account if you break the conditions of these terms.</p>
<h2>Abusive or Hateful Behavior</h2>
<p>We get it--it's hard to see eye to eye with people on the internet, especially when the only representation of them you can see is a small picture. But remember that, unless otherwise specified, there is a human being on the other side, and you need to make sure you're treating your fellow humans with respect while working out a disagreement.</p>
<p>We don't allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insults</li>
<li>Threats of any kind, including threats of bodily harm or property damage</li>
<li>Use of derogatory terms or symbols (e.g. slurs, hateful logos)</li>
<li>Spreading fear about someone or a specific group of people</li>
<li>Revealing sensitive information about others, such as home, email, or IP addresses, phone numbers, or passwords, without their consent</li>
<li>The promotion or gratification of any of the above behaviors</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age</h2>
<p>Photop, like almost all social media platforms on the internet, requires users to be at least 13 years old. If an account is created or managed by a person under the age of 13, that account will be terminated--no exceptions.</p>
<h2>Child Exploitation</h2>
<p>This one should be obvious. We don't allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The promotion or glorification of child abuse, whether physical, verbal, or sexual</li>
<li>Illustrated or computer-generated graphics of children involved in sexual or violent acts</li>
<li>Links to third-party sites that host material of child exploitation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Glorification of Violence</h2>
<p>This one should be pretty obvious. Everyone sane knows that violence is wrong, and in most cases, pretty horrifying. We don't allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The celebration or praise of violent acts that result in death or serious injury</li>
<li>The celebration or praise of terrorist groups, violent extremists, or state-sponsored violent groups, or any acts they commit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impersonation</h2>
<p>We believe that everyone on Photop should be themselves. Trying to be someone you're not, especially with bad intentions, just isn't cool.</p>
<p>We don't allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creation of accounts that are intended to impersonate or defame another person</li>
<li>The use of images, logos, or icons of another person or entity without their consent</li>
</ul>
<p>Photop does allow the following, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts that share similar usernames, but do not have anything else in common</li>
<li>Parody accounts that are marked as such in the profile description</li>
<li>Newsfeed or fan accounts, such as those dedicated to a celebrity or public figure</li>
</ul>
<h2>Misleading Information</h2>
<p>The internet has its fair share of false information already. We don't need more, especially on Photop.</p>
<p>We don't allow the following...</p>
<ul>
<li>The spread of misinformation about scientific topics, such as diseases or vaccines, or widely-proven topics, such as the shape of the planet</li>
<li>The spread of misinformation about specific users, such as their thoughts, rationale, or actions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Platform Manipulation</h2>
<p>Photop's algorithm, like many other content ranking algorithms, is designed to display organic, relevant, and popular content. Unfortunately, some people seek to claim the top spot on the algorithm for clout.</p>
<p>We don't allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using bots to maintain a post's position on the algorithm</li>
<li>Using bots to interact with posts without being triggered</li>
<ul>
<li>An example of a bot that is allowed is a bot that will respond to a post's chats when the post's text says or contains a command specific to the bot, such as "!connect".</li>
<li>Bots that are not allowed under this rule are bots that will respond to posts automatically without being intentionally triggered by the user.</li>
</ul>
<li>Sending repeated posts</li>
<ul>
<li>Examples include gibberish, the same text or image content over and over again, or blank posts</li>
</ul>
<li>Sending chats on posts that are irrelevant to the topic of the post</li>
<li>Repeatedly liking/unliking, following/unfollowing, etc.</li>
<li>Fake engagement, such as liking or following large numbers of posts or accounts, or purchasing automated likes/followers</li>
<li>Sending unwanted invites to groups</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Media</h2>
<p>There are plenty of places to share inappropriate, sexual, or violent content on the internet. Photop is not one of those, especially since most of the user base is made up of those aged 13-18. We don't allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual content in images, including cropped, blurred, or otherwise obscured content</li>
<li>Sexual content or allusion in text</li>
<li>Extreme violence in images, including excessive gore</li>
<ul>
<li>An exception to this rule is when used as an image in a news article or publication detailing a graphic event. Any blood or gore must be blurred, and a warning modal must be visible on the website.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Suicide or Self-Harm</h2>
<p>Enough is going on in everyone's lives as is. The last thing a Photop developer, moderator, or user needs in their life is the knowledge that their content contributed to someone's death or harm. We don't allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The promotion, glorification, or suggestion that someone should commit suicide or harm themselves</li>
<li>Asking or telling others to harm or kill themselves</li>
<li>Sharing methods or strategies that would prove effective in a suicide or self-harm attempt</li>
</ul>`;
